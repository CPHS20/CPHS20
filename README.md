# CPHS21 Workshop - virtual

## The First International Workshop on Cyber-Physical-Human System Design and Implementation


**Call for contributions and participation!**

**Full-day workshop on May 18th, 2021 at [CPS-IOT Week](https://cps-iot-week2021.isis.vanderbilt.edu/#:~:text=CPS-IoT%20Week%20is%20the%20premier%20event%20on%20Cyber-Physical,CPS%2C%20and%20reunites%20the%20leading%20researchers%20in%20)**. The CPS-IOT Week contains five top conferences, HSCC, ICCPS, IPSN, RTAS and IoTDI, multiple workshops and tutorials and exhibitions. 

## Description

Cyber-physical-human systems (CPHS) are the foundation of many emerging applications such as home assistance, healthcare and wellbeing, smart infrastructure, smart manufacturing, and human-robot interactions. As an advanced subclass of CPS and IoT systems, CPHS emphasizes constructing human-friendly environments/devices and helping human to achieve their goals. Recent advance in AI has opened the possibility of scene and human behavior understanding to a new level. This human-centric view of CPHS significantly complicates system design and implementation, in terms of open behavior states, implicit human intent, dynamic device composition, as well as ethics, privacy, and security concerns.

This workshop intents to bring together academic, industrial, and government researchers to exchange CPHS design and implementation challenges and latest research results. We will solicit invited papers and open submissions. Both papers will be reviewed based on their research vision and academic contribution. We will also solicit posters for early work. 


## Topics of Interest

- Cognitive science foundation of human behavior and intent
- Human intent prediction and behavior understanding
- Scene understand and human-robot/object interaction
- Ethics, security, privacy and safety issues in CPHS
- On-body, implantable, and ambient devices for CPHS
- System architecture, network protocol, and services for CPHS
- Modeling, programming, inferencing, interfacing, and testing CPHS
- Data management, data quality, and machine learning
- CPHS applications, prototypes, and experiences 


## Call For Contributions

We cordially invite you to submit your contribution to the workshop. 

We welcome submissions of **full papers (MAX 8 pages), posters (MAX 2 pages) and 5-min videos** of relevant work. All the submissions will be  peer-reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. All the accepted submissions will be posted on the workshop's website and accepted full papers will be published on-line via IEEE Xplore. 

Submissions must be sent in pdf, following the [IEEE conference style (two-columns)](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) by the [HotCRP system](https://cphs21.hotcrp.com). For video submissions, please submit a pdf explaining the video and embed the link on the text. Any questions please send an email to chunzhiyi@hit.edu.cn.

Accepted contributions will have the opportunity to present their work/ideas to the audience of our workshop. 

Moreover, the program committee will select excellent contributions for the best paper award. 

We also welcome **nomination for the keynote speakers, the steering committee and the program committee of our workshop**.  The steering committee is responsible for organizing the next CPHS workshop.
