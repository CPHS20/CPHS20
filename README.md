# CPHS21 Workshop - virtual

## The First International Workshop on Cyber-Physical-Human System Design and Implementation


**Full-day workshop on May 18th, 2021 at [CPS-IOT Week](https://cps-iot-week2021.isis.vanderbilt.edu/#:~:text=CPS-IoT%20Week%20is%20the%20premier%20event%20on%20Cyber-Physical,CPS%2C%20and%20reunites%20the%20leading%20researchers%20in%20)**. The CPS-IOT Week contains five top conferences, HSCC, ICCPS, IPSN, RTAS and IoTDI, multiple workshops and tutorials and exhibitions. 

## Description

Cyber-physical-human systems (CPHS) are the foundation of many emerging applications such as home assistance, healthcare and wellbeing, smart infrastructure, smart manufacturing, and human-robot interactions. As an advanced subclass of CPS and IoT systems, CPHS emphasizes constructing human-friendly environments/devices and helping human to achieve their goals. Recent advance in AI has opened the possibility of scene and human behavior understanding to a new level. This human-centric view of CPHS significantly complicates system design and implementation, in terms of open behavior states, implicit human intent, dynamic device composition, as well as ethics, privacy, and security concerns.

This workshop intents to bring together academic, industrial, and government researchers to exchange CPHS design and implementation challenges and latest research results. We will solicit invited papers and open submissions. Both papers will be reviewed based on their research vision and academic contribution. We will also solicit posters for early work.

 -**Title** : ***Continuous Daily Status Monitoring of Elders with Commodity Wi-Fi Devices***
 
   With the ubiquitous deployment of Wi-Fi infrastructure in ordinary homes, WiFi-based contactless sensing has become an ideal way for elder care and health monitoring. While continuous daily activity monitoring has been found inaccurate and unstable using commodity Wi-Fi signals, due to well-known challenges in automatic activity segmentation and location/orientation independent activity recognition, hindering real applications of commodity WiFi-based solutions in home-based elder care. In this work, with the insight that an elder’s health status and living habits are closely related to one’s daily spatio-temporal activity patterns, we propose to build a continuous daily status monitoring system for elders using home-owned WiFi infrastructure. Specifically, we develop WiBorder – an accurate room-level localization algorithm to determine an elder’s location in real-time, and a continuous activity segmentation and identification system to report elder’s activity status, in such a way we could obtain an elder’s daily status log in the form of triple (time, location, activity) continuously and non-intrusively. By analyzing and visualizing an elder’s daily status log, we could inform an elder’s daily habits, health status, abnormal events and gradual behavior changes.
